# Live Server Backup — Production GOAT/Oscar

This directory is a **source backup of the code actually running in production**,
pulled from the VPS so the master repo reflects the real, latest deployment.

> **Why this exists:** the live server runs a much newer/larger Oscar than the
> `apps/` copies (live `chat_server.py` is ~9.5k lines vs ~530 in `apps/`). This
> folder captures the production source so it isn't trapped only on the VPS.

## `srv1148455` (production — 72.61.193.184, `srv1148455.hstgr.cloud`)

Ingress is **nginx** (ports 80/443). Apps run as `systemd` services.

> **Traefik:** a Traefik container (`docker/traefik/docker-compose.yml`, `network_mode: host`)
> was stuck in a crash loop (66,870 restarts) because it could not bind :80/:443 —
> **nginx** already owns those ports and serves all live sites. On 2026-06-29 it was
> **stopped and its restart policy set to `no`** (it routed no traffic, so this caused
> no downtime). The compose file is preserved here for reference; to ever use Traefik
> as ingress you'd first need to move nginx off 80/443, then `docker compose up -d`.

### Excluded from this backup (intentionally)
- **Secrets** — `intel/local_keys.json` held a live xAI API key; replaced with
  `intel/local_keys.json.example`. **That key was exposed and should be rotated.**
- **Data / PII** — `intel/fans.db` (SQLite fan data).
- **Private chat history** — `oscar/chat_data/`.
- **Backups / caches / media** — `BackupVault/`, `__pycache__/`, server tarballs,
  and the 36 MB branding `.mp4` under `www-goat/videos/`.

This is a point-in-time snapshot (pulled 2026-06-29). It is a backup/reference —
deploying changes back to the server is a separate, deliberate step.
